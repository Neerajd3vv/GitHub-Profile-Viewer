## ðŸš€ Deploying to Vercel

Vercel offers an easy way to deploy React applications directly from your GitHub repository.

### Step-by-step Guide

1. **Push Your Project to GitHub**
   
   Make sure your project is committed and pushed to a GitHub repository.

2. **Create a Vercel Account**

   If you donâ€™t already have one, sign up at [https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com).

3. **Import Your GitHub Repository**

   - Go to [https://vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
   - Select your GitHub repo containing the GitHub profile viewer project.
   - Vercel will automatically detect that you are using a React + TypeScript setup.

4. **Set Build Settings**

   These are usually auto-detected, but just in case:

   - **Framework Preset:** Vite
   - **Build Command:** `npm run build` or `yarn build`
   - **Output Directory:** `dist` (for Vite) or `build` (for CRA). Adjust if different.
   - **Install Command:** `npm install` or `yarn`


5. **Deploy**

Click **Deploy** and wait for Vercel to build and deploy your project. Once completed, Vercel will provide a live URL.
